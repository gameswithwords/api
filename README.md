# Get started

Clone the parent repo with the docker-compose file, insure that DB tables and seeds have been ran.

- to run the seeds, use `docker ps` get the process id for `pushkin_db` and execute `docker exec -it PROCESS_ID node seeder.js` 
- remember you can shell into a docker container at any time

Make a request to `localhost/api/initialQuestions` to test this api.

# Extension
- Feel free to modify the logging mechanism
- Build and define new express routes.
